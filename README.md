# Credit_Risk_Analysis

Machine Learning (ML) offers great promise of improving the value of analysis. To see ML in action, I applied two key analytical techniques to a collection of loan data. I wanted to see if ML might give me a way to predict, given a broad number of data points, which loans would be high-risk.

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
I focused on two ML techniques in this challenge: **Oversampling** (amplifying the values of the smaller dataset to improve analysis) and **Undersampling** (diminishing the values of the larger dataset). 


## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
